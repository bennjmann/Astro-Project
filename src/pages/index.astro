					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>
						Hello, my name is Bennjmann. You can call me Ben for short. I am a web developer from Sunshine Coast, QLD, and I am currently studying for a bachelor of information technology majoring in computer science at QUT.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've been using and creating with technology since I was a kid. It has become a passion and hobby, and I enjoy every bit of the process. I started my journey by making games in engines like Gamer Maker and Scratch.
						These sparked my interest in technology, and so I expanded my knowledge in the technology field by doing a Cert 3 in information and technology and a Cert 2 in Creative Industries at AIE.
						during this period I worked as a full-time construction material tester, which helped to expand my communication skills and gain an eye for producing quality results. Additionally, I gained a Cert 3 in Construction Material Testing.
						Now leading to my current day job of working as a web developer for the past 2 years and starting my studies for a bachelor's in Information and Technology, majoring in Computer Science  at QUT
					</p>
					<p>
						For a <a href="#skills"><u>list of the skills</u></a> i've gain throughout my studies and career.
